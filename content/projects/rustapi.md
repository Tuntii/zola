# RustAPI 🦀

### FastAPI ergonomics. Rust performance. AI‑ready by design.

**RustAPI** is a modern, batteries‑included **Rust web framework** designed for building high‑performance APIs with an exceptional developer experience.

Inspired by **FastAPI**, RustAPI lets you define complete REST endpoints in just a few lines of code — with **automatic OpenAPI documentation**, strong typing, and async performance out of the box.

---

## ✨ Why RustAPI?

* ⚡ **FastAPI‑like ergonomics** in Rust
* 🦀 Built for **performance, safety, and scalability**
* 📄 Automatic **OpenAPI / Swagger** documentation
* 🔐 Built‑in **JWT authentication**, CORS, and rate limiting
* 🧠 **MCP‑ready** with native **TOON format** support for LLMs
* 🧩 Modular, opt‑in features via Cargo flags

---

## 🤖 AI & MCP First‑Class Support

RustAPI is designed with **AI backends and MCP servers** in mind.

With native **TOON format** support, RustAPI enables:

* 📉 **40–60% token savings** for LLM payloads
* 🚀 Faster request / response cycles
* 🧠 Seamless integration with modern AI workflows

Perfect for:

* MCP servers
* LLM‑powered APIs
* AI agents and orchestration layers

---

## 🛠 Developer Experience That Scales

RustAPI focuses on **clarity and productivity** without sacrificing control:

* Type‑safe request & response handling
* Schema auto‑registration via macros
* Clean, minimal API surface
* Async‑first architecture powered by Tokio

> Write less boilerplate. Ship faster. Stay in Rust.

---

## 🚀 Use Cases

* REST & JSON APIs
* AI / LLM backends
* Microservices
* Internal tooling
* High‑performance web services

---

## 📦 Getting Started

Install via Cargo:

```bash
cargo add rustapi-rs
```

Define an API endpoint in minutes and get instant docs at `/docs`.

---

## 🌍 Open Source & Community‑Driven

RustAPI is **open source** and actively evolving.

Contributions, feedback, and ideas are always welcome.
